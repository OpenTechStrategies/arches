### Breaking changes
- Recent versions of Arches made a "best" effort to ensure that field values injected by Django model `save()` methods were not evaded by the use of `update_or_create()` in recent versions of Django. Such uses of `update_or_create()` now raise `FutureWarning`. If you find this warning in your logs or tests, assess whether you need the injected values and opt-in by providing such field names in `defaults`:

```py
TileModel.objects.update_or_create(
    pk=provisional_tile.pk,
    nodegroup_id=provisional_tile.nodegroup_id,
    # presence of "sortorder" in defaults signifies that the
    # sortorder re-calculation in TileModel.save() is wanted.
    defaults={"sortorder": random.randint()},
)
```
