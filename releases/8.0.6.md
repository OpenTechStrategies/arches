Arches 8.0.6 Release Notes
--------------------------

### Bug Fixes and Enhancements
- Fix date datatype bug in which a datetime value loses time details when it's imported [#12476](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/issues/12476)
- The date datatype now formats the imported data based on the date format specified in the node configuration, consistent with the editor’s behavior. Also, all exporters now export the date exactly as it appears in the tile data[#12480](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/issues/12480)
