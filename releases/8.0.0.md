```

### Breaking changes
- The minimum supported version of Python is now 3.11.

- The minimum supported version of GDAL is now 2.4 (along with GEOS 3.8).

- `TileModel.nodegroup` is no longer a foreign key. It can now store UUIDs referring to historical nodegroups that no longer exist. There is still a Django model field called `nodegroup` for expressing joins, but it is now nullable.

- Following a deprecation in 7.6.0, the `-o install` argument to `manage.py packages` has been removed.

- `ensure_userprofile_exists()` was removed from the `Tile` model.

- The `arches` object is now only available in frontend components that are mounted in templates that inherit from `base.htm`. If your project contains components that are mounted in templates that inherit directly from `base-root.htm`, they will need to be updated to use `generateArchesURL` and the settings API instead. Please refer to [Upgrading an Arches project](#upgrading-an-arches-project).

- The following fields are no longer nullable. If you have custom SQL (or Python code that uses direct ORM operations to bypass model `save()`, etc.), you will need to set these fields directly on creation:
    - `Node.alias`
    - `TileModel.data`

- `ResourceXResource` model field names changed (without altering database column names):

    - `resourceinstanceidfrom` -> `from_resource`
    - `resourceinstanceidto` -> `to_resource`
    - `resourceinstancefrom_graphid` -> `from_resource_graph`
    - `resourceinstanceto_graphid` -> `to_resource_graph`
    - `nodeid` -> `node`
    - `tileid` -> `tile`

- `ResourceXResource` model fields removed:
    - `datestarted`
    - `dateended`

- The .relations file importer now accepts only the updated column headers:
    - `resourceinstanceidfrom` -> `from_resource`
    - `resourceinstanceidto` -> `to_resource`
    - `resourceinstancefrom_graphid` -> `from_resource_graph`
    - `resourceinstanceto_graphid` -> `to_resource_graph`
    - `nodeid` -> `node`
    - `tileid` -> `tile`

- The following fields implemented [`related_name`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name) and [`related_query_name`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_query_name) to improve upon the Django-supplied defaults:
    - `NodeGroup.parentnodegroup`
    - `TileModel.nodegroup`
    - `TileModel.parenttile`

    For instance, a tile query can prefetch its children with the more readable:
    ```
    TileModel.objects.filter(...).prefetch_related("children")
    ```

    Rather than:
    ```
    TileModel.objects.filter(...).prefetch_related("tilemodel_set")  # OLD NAME
    ```

    In the event you had ORM queries traversing the "reverse" side of these relationships,
    (i.e. from one to many), make these changes:

    - From NodeGroup, traversing a child nodegroup: `nodegroup` -> `child`
    - From NodeGroup, collecting child nodegroups: `nodegroup_set` -> `children`
    - From NodeGroup, traversing a tile: `tilemodel` -> `tile`
    - From NodeGroup, collecting all tiles: `tilemodel_set` -> `tiles`
    - From TileModel, traversing a child tile: `tilemodel` -> `child`
    - From TileModel, collecting child tiles: `tilemodel_set` -> `children`

- The related names on `ResourceXResource` were improved as follows:
    - From ResourceInstance, collecting relationships:
        - `resxres_resource_instance_ids_from` -> `from_resxres`
        - `resxres_resource_instance_ids_to` -> `to_resxres`
    - From Graph:
        - `resxres_resource_instance_fom_graph_id` -> `from_resxres`
        - `resxres_resource_instance_to_graph_id` -> `to_resxres`
    - From TileModel: `resxres_tile_id` -> `resxres_tile_id`
    - From Node: `resxres_node_id` -> `resxres`

- The following models now have a default ordering by `sortorder` (or for ETLModule, `helpsortorder`):
    - CardModel (and Card)
    - CardXNodeXWidget
    - Node
    - Plugin
    - ETLModule

    In the event this ordering is not desired, chain an explicit ``order_by()`` with no arguments.

- Tile cardinality errors raised when saving `TileModel` instances now raise `TileCardinalityError` rather than `ProgrammingError`.

- `TileValidationError` and `TileCardinalityError` now subclass `django.core.exceptions.ValidationError`.

- `GraphModel.get_published_graph()` no longer accepts the `raise_if_missing` argument.
- `Graph.new()` has been deprecated in favor of `Graph.objects.create_graph()`
- `WorkflowHistoryView` moved from `arches.app.views.workflow_history` to `arches.app.views.api`.
- The format of JavaScript files has changed. Please refer to [Upgrading an Arches project](#upgrading-an-arches-project).
- The format of how some images are loaded in template files has changed. Please refer to [Upgrading an Arches project](#upgrading-an-arches-project).
- Following a deprecation in 7.6 `arches-project` management commands have been removed.


### Upgrading Arches

1. You must be upgraded to at least version before proceeding. If you are on an earlier version, please refer to the upgrade process in the []()

1. Be sure to backup your database before proceeding.

1. Upgrade to Arches 8.0.0
    ```
    pip install --upgrade arches==8.0.0
    ```

### Upgrading an Arches project

1. In pyproject.toml, make these updates:
    - Update `requires = ["setuptools", "setuptools-scm"]` to `requires = ["setuptools>=77", "setuptools-scm"]`.
    - Update `requires-python` to `">=3.11"`
    - Remove `"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10"`
    - Add `"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.13"`
    - Remove `"Framework :: Django :: 4.2"`
    - Add `"Framework :: Django :: 5.2"`
    - Remove any classifier beginning with "License :: "

1. Update `.gitignore`:
    - Remove:
        ```
        .tsconfig-paths.json
        .frontend-configuration-settings.json
        ```
    - Add: 
        ```
        frontend_configuration

        # Packaging
        build/
        dist/
        ```

1. Replace any references to `arches-project` management commands with `arches-admin`
    - `arches-project create` no longer exists, instead use `arches-admin startproject`

1. In `MANIFEST.in`, remove "graft *". Add exclusions for local settings files, e.g. `exclude <my_project>/settings_local.py`.

1. In settings.py:
    - Add the following key to `DATABASES` to [potentially improve indexing performance](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/issues/11382):
        ```
        DATABASES = {
            "default": {
                ...  # other entries 
                "OPTIONS": {
                    "options": "-c cursor_tuple_fraction=1",
                },
            }
        }
        ```
    - Change the "captcha" entry in `INSTALLED_APPS` to reflect its new name:
        ```
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...
            "django_recaptcha",  # was "captcha"
            ...
        ]
        ```
    - In `LOGGING`, replace `"loggers"` with the following to begin logging failed web requests:
        ```
            "loggers": {
                "arches": {
                    "handlers": ["file", "console"],
                    "level": "WARNING",
                    "propagate": True,
                },
                "django.request": {
                    "handlers": ["file", "console"],
                    "level": "WARNING",  # or consider ERROR if this is too noisy
                    "propagate": True,
                },
                # consider adding your own project here if it logs
            },
        ```
    - Remove `OVERRIDE_RESOURCE_MODEL_LOCK` if present.

1. Apply migrations: 
    - Within your project, with your Python 3 virtual environment activated run:
        ``` 
        python manage.py migrate
        ```

1. Apply automatic updates:
    ```
    python manage.py updateproject
    ```

1. Verify in ``<project_name>/apps.py`` that you no longer have a ``ready()`` method.

1. Update your urls.py to include generic error handlers:

    ```
    handler400 = "arches.app.views.main.custom_400"
    handler403 = "arches.app.views.main.custom_403"
    handler404 = "arches.app.views.main.custom_404"
    handler500 = "arches.app.views.main.custom_500"
    ```

1. Create draft_graphs for your Resource Models:
    ```
    python manage.py graph create_draft_graphs
    ``` 
    
    This will publish new versions of each Graph.

1. Update your Graph publications and Resource instances to point to the newly published Graphs:
    ```
    python manage.py graph publish --update -ui
    ```

1. Also consider running validation checks:
    ```
    python manage.py validate
    python manage.py validate --fix [error]
    ```

1. Reindex your database:
    - Within your project with your Python 3 virtual environment activated:
        ```
        python manage.py es reindex_database
        ```

1. Update your frontend dependencies:
    ```
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    npm install
    ```

1. Update your project's `package.json`:
    - Remove any references to `NODE_OPTIONS` and `NODE_ENV`

        ```json
        <!-- defunct format -->

        "scripts": {
            "build_development": "npm run eslint:check && npm run ts:check && cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js",
            "build_production": "npm run eslint:check && npm run ts:check && cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 NODE_ENV=production webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.prod.js",
            "build_test": "npm run eslint:check && npm run ts:check && cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js --env test=true",
            ...
            "start": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048 webpack serve --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js",
        },
        ```

        ```json
        <!-- updated format -->

        "scripts": {
            "build_development": "npm run eslint:check && npm run ts:check && cross-env webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js",
            "build_production": "npm run eslint:check && npm run ts:check && cross-env webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.prod.js",
            "build_test": "npm run eslint:check && npm run ts:check && cross-env webpack --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js --env test=true",
            ...
            "start": "cross-env webpack serve --config ./webpack/webpack.config.dev.js",
        },
        ```

    - Update auto-fixers to apply to staged files only by default:
    ```json
    <!-- defunct format -->

    "scripts": {
        ...
        "eslint:fix": "eslint **/src --fix",
        ...
        "prettier:fix": "prettier {{ project_name }}/src --write",
        ...
    },
    ```

    ```json
    <!-- updated format -->

    "scripts": {
        "eslint:fix": "eslint --fix",
        "eslint:fix:all": "npm run eslint:fix **/src",
        ...
        "prettier:fix": "prettier --write",
        "prettier:fix:all": "npm run prettier:fix **/src",
        ...
    },
    ```

1. Update any imports from `@primevue/themes` to `@primeuix/themes`:
    ```js
    // defunct format

    import { definePreset, palette } from "@primevue/themes";
    import Aura from "@primevue/themes/aura";

    ```

    ```js
    // updated format

    import { definePreset, palette } from "@primeuix/themes";
    import Aura from "@primeuix/themes/aura";

    ```

1. Update the JavaScript files in your project:
    1. Update the import and export logic. 
        - Imports should follow the typical ES6 import pattern
        - Anything `return`-ed from a RequireJS function should be the default export of the file.

            ```js
            // defunct format

            define([
                'knockout', 
                'viewmodels/report', 
                'templates/views/report-templates/default.htm',
            ], function(ko, ReportViewModel, defaultReportTemplate) {
                return ko.components.register('default-report', {
                    viewModel: function (params) {
                        params.configKeys = [];
                        ReportViewModel.apply(this, [params]);
                    },
                    template: defaultReportTemplate
                });
            });

            ```
            ```js
            // updated format

            import ko from 'knockout';
            import ReportViewModel from 'viewmodels/report';
            import defaultReportTemplate from 'templates/views/report-templates/default.htm';

            export default ko.components.register('default-report', {
                viewModel: function (params) {
                    params.configKeys = [];
                    ReportViewModel.apply(this, [params]);
                },
                template: defaultReportTemplate
            });
            ```

    1. If you have created a custom knockout binding, you must bind any declared functions to the object.
        ```js
        // defunct format

        define([
            'knockout',
        ], function(ko) {
            ko.bindingHandlers.hover = {
                init: function(element, valueAccessor) {
                    var value = valueAccessor();
                    ko.applyBindingsToNode(element, {
                        event: {
                            mouseenter: function() { value(true); },
                            mouseleave: function() { value(false); }
                        }
                    });
                }
            };
            return ko.bindingHandlers.hover;
        });

        ```

        ```js
        // updated format

        import ko from 'knockout';

        ko.bindingHandlers.hover = {
            init: function(element, valueAccessor) {
                var value = valueAccessor();
                ko.applyBindingsToNode(element, {
                    event: {
                        mouseenter: function() { value(true); },
                        mouseleave: function() { value(false); }
                    }
                });
            }
        };
        ko.bindingHandlers.hover.init = ko.bindingHandlers.hover.init.bind(ko.bindingHandlers.hover);

        export default ko.bindingHandlers.hover;

        ```

    1. If you are importing in the body of your JavaScript components, those imports should be moved to the top.
        ```js
        // defunct format

        define([
            'jquery',
            'underscore',
            'knockout',
            'arches',
            'report-templates',
            'models/report',
            'models/graph',
            'viewmodels/alert',
            'templates/views/components/resource-report-abstract.htm',
            'viewmodels/card',
        ], function($, _, ko, arches, reportLookup, ReportModel, GraphModel, AlertViewmodel, resourceReportAbstractTemplate) {
            var ResourceReportAbstract = function(params) {
                var self = this; 
                var CardViewModel = require('viewmodels/card');
                ...
        ```

        ```js
        // updated format

        import $ from 'jquery';
        import _ from 'underscore';
        import ko from 'knockout';
        import arches from 'arches';
        import reportLookup from 'report-templates';
        import ReportModel from 'models/report';
        import GraphModel from 'models/graph';
        import AlertViewmodel from 'viewmodels/alert';
        import resourceReportAbstractTemplate from 'templates/views/components/resource-report-abstract.htm';
        import CardViewModel from 'viewmodels/card';


        var ResourceReportAbstract = function(params) {
            var self = this;
            ...
        ```

1. Update the templates in your project:
    - Any interpolation of `STATIC_URL` should be replaced with `webpack_static`

        ```html
        <!-- defunct format -->

        <img id="map-buffer-search-help-gif" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/help/map-buffer-search.gif" aria-hidden="true"></img>
        ```
        ```html
        <!-- updated format -->

        <img id="map-buffer-search-help-gif" src="{% webpack_static 'img/help/map-buffer-search.gif' %}" aria-hidden="true"></img>
        ```

1. Replace `arches.urls` references:
    - This step is optional for any template that extends `base.htm`. If a template directly extends `base-root.htm`, this step is required.
    - Support for `arches.urls` will be removed in later versions.
    - Instead of accessing urls via `import arches from "arches";`, you can instead use the `generateArchesURL` utility.

        ```js
        // defunct format

        import arches from "arches";

        const url = arches.urls.my_awesome_url(
            graphId,
            resourceInstanceId,
            nodeId,
        ),
        fetch(url).then(resp => {...});
        ```

        ```js
        // updated format

        import { generateArchesURL } from "@/arches/utils/generate-arches-url.ts";

        const url = generateArchesURL(
            "my_awesome_url", 
            {
                graph_id: graphId 
                resource_instance_id: resourceInstanceId,
                node_id: nodeId 
            }
        );
        fetch(url).then(resp => {...});
        ```

    - If you update your project to remove any reference to `arches.urls`, you can then safely delete `templates/arches_urls.htm`

1. Rebuild your static asset bundle:
    - Ensure your Python 3 virtual environment activated

    - If running your project in development:
        - Option 1: Development Mode (Live Rebuilding)
            ```
            npm start
            ```
            This will build the frontend of the application and then start a webpack development server. The webpack development server will automatically detect changes to bundled assets and rebuild the static asset bundle. This process should take less than 30 seconds.

        - Option 2: Development Build with Checks
            ```
            npm run build_development
            ```
            This will run ESLint and TypeScript checks, then build the static asset bundle. This process should take less than 30 seconds.

    - If running your project in production:
        ```
        npm run build_production
        ```
        This will build a minimized, production-ready static asset bundle. This process should take less than 5 minutes.

1. (optional) Collect static files:
    ```
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

    This will gather all static files (CSS, JavaScript, Vue, images, etc) and copy them into your projects `STATIC_ROOT` directory. This step does not need to be done if developing locally.
